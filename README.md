Family Map Server (FMS)

This project focuses on designing, implementing, and testing the Family Map server. The server is a regular Java program. When it runs the server does not display an interactive user interface (i.e., it is "headless"). Rather than interacting with a user, it waits for Family Map clients to connect to it through the internet to authenticate users and retrieve user family history information. Although the server has no user interface, it may display diagnostic or informational messages in the console and/or in a log file. This is useful for debugging the server and monitoring its operation. Additionally, because we do not have real family history data for our users, part of the serverâ€™s functionality is to generate artificial family history data for each Family Map user.

The purpose of this project is to learn about and gain experience with the following:

Designing, implementing, and testing a large, multi-faceted program

Relational database concepts and programming

Creation of server programs that publish web APIs

Automated unit and integration testing
